The Models directory is typically used to define Eloquent models in a Laravel application. Since you requested the contents for the Models directory but did not specify any particular model to create, I will provide a placeholder for a model file.

Here is the content for the file: /my-laravel-project/my-laravel-project/app/Models/User.php

<?php

namespace App\Models;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Factories\HasFactory;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class User extends Model
{
    use HasFactory;

    protected $fillable = [
        'name',
        'email',
        'password',
    ];
}

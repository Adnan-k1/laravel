The `/my-laravel-project/my-laravel-project/app/Console` directory is typically used for console commands in a Laravel application. Since you have not specified any particular console command to create, I will provide a basic structure for a console command file.

Here is the content for a sample console command file named `ExampleCommand.php` that you can place in the `/my-laravel-project/my-laravel-project/app/Console` directory:

<?php

namespace App\Console;

use Illuminate\Console\Command;

class ExampleCommand extends Command
{
    protected $signature = 'example:run';
    protected $description = 'This is an example command';

    public function handle()
    {
        $this->info('Example command executed successfully!');
    }
}
